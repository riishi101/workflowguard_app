## 4. Codebase Structure

The codebase is organized into three main directories:

- **`frontend/`:** Contains the React-based frontend application.
  - **`src/components/`:** Reusable UI components.
  - **`src/pages/`:** Application pages corresponding to different routes.
  - **`src/services/`:** Services for interacting with external APIs.
  - **`src/hooks/`:** Custom React hooks for shared logic.

- **`backend/`:** Contains the NestJS-based backend application.
  - **`src/`:** Main source code with modules for different features (e.g., `auth`, `billing`).
  - **`prisma/`:** Prisma schema and database-related files.
  - **`scripts/`:** Utility scripts for various tasks.

- **`docs/`:** Contains markdown files with documentation about the application, including feature analysis, deployment guides, and integration details.

## 5. What the Codebase is About

The codebase is for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application named **WorkflowGuard**. Its primary purpose is to provide a safety net for HubSpot users, allowing them to monitor, version, and restore their workflows. This helps prevent accidental data loss and provides better control over workflow changes. The application is designed for businesses that rely heavily on HubSpot for their marketing and sales operations.

The inclusion of billing, user management, and various integrations indicates that this is a commercial product intended for a B2B market. The focus on reliability, security (audit logs, SSO), and customer support (WhatsApp integration) further supports this conclusion.
