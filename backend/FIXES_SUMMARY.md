# WorkflowGuard Backend - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Duplicate Keys in tsconfig.json**
   - Removed duplicate `emitDecoratorMetadata` and `experimentalDecorators` properties
   - Resolved 4 JSON validation errors in the IDE

2. **Environment Variable Loading Issues**
   - Recreated the .env file with proper encoding
   - Fixed the "Razorpay credentials not found in environment variables" error
   - Verified that all required environment variables are properly loaded

3. **Build Process Issues**
   - Confirmed that the TypeScript compilation works correctly
   - Verified that the dist folder is generated with all necessary files
   - Ensured that main.js is properly compiled and can be executed

## Changes Made

### 1. tsconfig.json
- Removed duplicate object keys:
  - `emitDecoratorMetadata` (appeared twice)
  - `experimentalDecorators` (appeared twice)

### 2. .env File
- Recreated with proper UTF-8 encoding
- Ensured all required environment variables are present:
  - Database configuration
  - Application configuration
  - HubSpot integration credentials
  - Security settings (JWT secret)
  - Payment processing (Razorpay credentials)
  - WhatsApp/Twilio support credentials

### 3. Build Process
- Verified that `npm run build` works correctly
- Confirmed that `npx tsc` compiles all TypeScript files properly
- Ensured that the postbuild script copies Prisma files correctly

## Verification

1. **Environment Variables**: ✅ Working
   - Razorpay credentials are now properly loaded
   - All other environment variables are accessible

2. **Build Process**: ✅ Working
   - TypeScript compilation completes without errors
   - All necessary JavaScript files are generated in the dist folder

3. **Application Startup**: ✅ Working
   - Application starts successfully
   - Razorpay service initializes correctly
   - All modules load without errors (except database which is expected locally)

## Next Steps

1. For local development, either:
   - Set up a local PostgreSQL database with the correct credentials
   - Use a different database configuration for local development

2. For production deployment:
   - Ensure the environment variables are properly set in the deployment environment
   - Verify database connectivity in the production environment

The core issues with TypeScript compilation and environment variable loading have been resolved.
